# Task board — procedural-graph parallel work

Routable tasks for parallel agents. Each row points at a brief (the contract) and a
disjoint set of owned files so independent tasks run safely in parallel.

Protocol: claim the first UNCLAIMED task by editing its `Claimed by:` line; stay inside
your `Owns:` files; the brief is the contract. **Gate = `check` AND `test`** for every
package you touch (vitest alone is not enough — `tsc`/svelte-check must pass too), keep all
prior tests green, and for WGSL output do a validity check. Commit your task as its own
stage commit; set `Status: DONE <hash>`. ⚠ visual tasks: paste a screenshot of the
confirmed behaviour. PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin:$PATH"`.
Tabs; verbatimModuleSyntax. See `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/execution-and-delegation.md` §Gate hardening.

Coordinate only on shared files (e.g. `GraphEditor.svelte`): note who owns the shared edit.
The critical *dependency chain* stays serialized — never start a task whose prerequisite
is still open.

## Archive — landed

- **Tier 1 — trustworthy editor pipeline** (all reviewed green, visual-confirmed):
  - T-A compiled-WGSL view — `63e2ea9`
  - T-B incomplete/invalid-graph flagging (editor surfacing) — `b1761ae`
  - T-C reliable recompile + honest node source — `a8d758f`
  - T-D 🔴 real geometry + vertex codegen (replaced pipeline stubs; no-stub guard) — `07f0ba5`
- **Pipeline output reconciliation** — `target.display` as implicit sink; stale output cleanup on delete — `3a2b6bd`
- **Pipeline consumer derivation** — derive implicit fragment image consumer + synthetic outputs for compile/preview when doc metadata is empty — `bbf649f`
- **Format-adaptive preview buffer list** — enumerate graph output buffers by family; buffer selector replaces backend tabs — `c65912c`
- **Node palette organization** — search + section/contract/both grouping with collapsible groups — `8e358e1`
- **Preview effective doc fix** — preview panels and compile path use `effectiveGraphDocument` — `e1cd183`
- **Palette collapsed by default** — opt-in `expandedByMode` per grouping mode; search still auto-expands — `f1de8b1`
- **Fullscreen-fragment params binding** — declare and bind `GraphParams` in image consumer — `aa309e9`
