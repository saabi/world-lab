# Task board — procedural-graph parallel work

Routable tasks for parallel agents. Each row points at a brief (the contract) and a
disjoint set of owned files so independent tasks run safely in parallel.

Protocol: claim the first UNCLAIMED task by editing its `Claimed by:` line; stay inside
your `Owns:` files; the brief is the contract. **Gate = `check` AND `test`** for every
package you touch (vitest alone is not enough — `tsc`/svelte-check must pass too), keep all
prior tests green, and for WGSL output do a validity check. Commit your task as its own
stage commit (**`git add -A` your scope incl. new test files — `git status` must show nothing
untracked in your scope before `DONE`; the orchestrator commits briefs/board/README/pending_issues**);
set `Status: DONE <hash>`. ⚠ visual tasks: paste a screenshot of the
confirmed behaviour. PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin:$PATH"`.
Tabs; verbatimModuleSyntax. See `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/execution-and-delegation.md` §Gate hardening.

Coordinate only on shared files (e.g. `GraphEditor.svelte`): note who owns the shared edit.
The critical *dependency chain* stays serialized — never start a task whose prerequisite
is still open.

_(none claimed — add tasks below as briefs are pinned.)_

## Ready to route

- **Preview lists every render target** — a graph with two `target.display` sinks lists only
  one preview buffer: `enumeratePreviewBuffers` keys by field-output, so two targets sharing a
  field collapse. Key pipeline buffers by the sink node id (one buffer per sink). Owns
  `previewBuffers.ts`.

- **Port quick-connect (right-click a port → add compatible connected node)** — right-click an
  output port → menu of type-compatible consumers; input port → compatible producers; select →
  node added and wired. New `compatibleConsumers`/`compatibleProducers` (graph) +
  `add-connected-node` intent (irAdapter) + `PortConnectMenu.svelte`. Owns graph helper,
  `irAdapter.ts`, `GraphNodeView.svelte`, new menu — parallel-safe (coordinate `GraphNodeView`
  only if another editor task touches it).
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-port-quick-connect.md`  ·  Claimed by: UNCLAIMED

- **Save pane layout with each graph + load toggle** — persist the `LayoutDocument` in the
  saved/downloaded graph artifact (wrapper, not in the pure `GraphDocument`); a toggle next to
  Load (default ON) applies the graph's saved layout, else the default. Owns
  `documentStorage.ts` + `GraphEditor.svelte` (+ chrome flag). Coordinate on `GraphEditor.svelte`.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-per-graph-layout.md`  ·  Claimed by: UNCLAIMED

- **Image preview presents opaque RGB** — a valid pipeline renders blank because the fragment
  alpha (`constant.f32 → vec4f.w`, default 0) makes `putImageData` paint fully transparent.
  ShaderToy ignores `fragColor.a` for display; force alpha to 255 on present (in the readback
  or the panel). Owns `EffectPreviewPanel.svelte` (± the fullscreen readback).
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-image-preview-opaque-alpha.md`  ·  Claimed by: UNCLAIMED

- **Device-compile test hardening** (infra) — make `npm test` actually compile WGSL against a
  software WebGPU adapter (currently all device tests `skipIf(!hasWebGPU)` and silently skip);
  add a consumer-coverage device test that catches the "string-valid but GPU-rejected" class
  (bit us 3×). Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-device-compile-test-hardening.md`.

- **Node color-coding by category/contract** (quick win) — tint nodes by `category` or
  `swapFamily`, toggle in chrome. Owns `GraphNodeView.svelte` + a color-map module.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-node-color-coding.md`  ·  Claimed by: UNCLAIMED

- **Help/usage tooltips + drop SDF alias primitives** — render `help`/`usage` in the inspector;
  deregister `sdf.opUnion`/`opIntersect` (help-tip → `math.min`/`max`). Owns `InspectorPanel`
  (graph-editor) + sdf primitives (graph).
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-editor-help-tooltips.md`  ·  Claimed by: UNCLAIMED

- **`geometry.plane` orientation + dimensions** (user-flagged) — add width/height + orientation
  params (defaults reproduce the current fullscreen quad); WGSL + evalCPU parity. Owns
  `geometry.plane` primitive (graph) + plane WGSL (procedural-wgsl).
