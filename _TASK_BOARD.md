# Task board — procedural-graph parallel work

Routable tasks for parallel agents. Each row points at a brief (the contract) and a
disjoint set of owned files so independent tasks run safely in parallel.

Protocol: claim the first UNCLAIMED task by editing its `Claimed by:` line; stay inside
your `Owns:` files; the brief is the contract. **Gate = `check` AND `test`** for every
package you touch (vitest alone is not enough — `tsc`/svelte-check must pass too), keep all
prior tests green, and for WGSL output do a validity check. Commit your task as its own
stage commit (`git add -A` your scope incl. new test files — `git status` must show nothing
untracked in your scope before `DONE`). ⚠ visual tasks: paste a screenshot of the
confirmed behaviour. PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin:$PATH"`.
Tabs; verbatimModuleSyntax. See `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/execution-and-delegation.md` §Gate hardening.

**Status/ownership split (no split responsibility on one edit):** `Status: DONE <hash>` is
set **only on this file's row for your task**, in the **same stage commit** as your code —
this file is the single place task status lives. **Never edit a standalone brief `.md` under
`briefs/`** (not even a status line) — those are orchestrator-only, always, including marking
them done; editing one there and not committing it (or vice versa) is exactly the drift this
rule exists to prevent. The orchestrator commits briefs/README/pending_issues.

Coordinate only on shared files (e.g. `GraphEditor.svelte`): note who owns the shared edit.
The critical *dependency chain* stays serialized — never start a task whose prerequisite
is still open.

## Active

Three tasks pinned 2026-07-03 (divider polish landed); file ownership verified disjoint.

- **Palette drag-and-drop node placement**
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-palette-drag-drop.md`
  Owns: `packages/graph-editor/src/NodePalette.svelte`, `packages/graph-editor/src/GraphCanvas.svelte`
  (`GraphEditor.svelte`'s existing `addPrimitive`/`onchange` wiring is reused, not edited — if
  that assumption turns out wrong mid-task, stop and flag it here rather than editing a file
  another task might also touch)
  Claimed by: Auto · Status: in progress

- **Editor accessibility Phase A** (landmarks, skip link, fix the two existing a11y-lint
  warnings)
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-editor-a11y-phase-a.md`
  Owns: `apps/webgputoy/src/routes/+layout.svelte`, `packages/graph-editor/src/NodeSwapMenu.svelte`,
  `packages/graph-editor/src/PortConnectMenu.svelte`
  Claimed by: — · Status: unclaimed

## Done (recent)

- **Divider visual polish** — axis-aligned hover/active bar, `active` prop while dragging.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-divider-visual-polish.md`

- **User-facing node names** — `c2eb302` · optional `Node.name`; inspector rename field;
  canvas label falls back to primitive id; muted primitive id under custom names.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-node-naming.md`

- **Primitive help coverage (frontmatter-based, all nodes)** — `af69aef` · unified
  `formatBuiltinSource` + inspector fallback; backfilled `help` across noise/math/color/
  terrain/surface/SDF/host/effect primitives (62 blank → 0; 9 → 71/112 authored); guard test
  ensures no blank tooltips.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-primitive-help-coverage.md`

- **`geometry.plane` orientation + dimensions** — `a55b8c2` · width/height + Euler XYZ rotation;
  WGSL + evalCPU parity; defaults bit-identical fullscreen quad.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-plane-orientation-dimensions.md`

## Ready to route

- **Shared preview clock (synced uniforms)** — **SUPERSEDED** by `M-single-loop-preview.md`
  (✅ landed `4a7f43d`, fixed `c8dcceb`). Brief kept for history:
  `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-shared-preview-clock.md`

### Architecture direction (near-term; sequences existing briefs)

- **Unified preview execution** — Phase 1 (single-loop, independent outputs) ✅ landed
  (`4a7f43d` + key fix `c8dcceb`) — panes are views of one GraphFrameExecutor loop, shared
  uniforms, visually confirmed synced. **Remaining:** Part 3 — cross-target reads (render-target-
  as-texture GPU binding) + previous-frame ping-pong feedback — brief when a graph actually wires
  one output into another.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-unified-preview-execution.md`

params-as-inputs editor+codegen follow-on · Tier 2 (frame-graph GPU executor, resource GPU
binds, mesh-gen consumer, node-swap/groups/tooltips UX) · Tier 3 (transforms, colorlab
remainder, vegetation/terrain nodes) · Tier 4 (S0.5, planet PoC). See `work-plan.md`.

## Deferred — needs orchestrator review

- **Save pane layout with each graph + load toggle** — **DEFERRED → SUPERSEDED** by unified document
  system (`M-document-system.md`, landed). Original brief retained for history only.
  Brief: `_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/briefs/M-per-graph-layout.md`  ·  Claimed by: SUPERSEDED

## Archive — landed

- **Folded in from the retired nested board** (`_docs/architecture/procedural-graph/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  2026-06-29–era Codex coordination doc, unified into this one 2026-07-03 — see that file's
